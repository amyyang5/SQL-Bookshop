# SQL Bookshop

Welcome to the SQL Bookshop project! This project builds an inventory management system for a bookshop using PostgreSQL. The project involoves creating tables, managing data, and utilizing SQL queries to interact with the database effectively.

"My_bookshop" database is set up to store book-related information. SQL queries performed using insert, update, and delete in the "books" table, while also establishing connections between authors and books through an "authors" table. In addition, to categorize books, a "genres" table is created and associated with books using joins and references.
